# Clustering_K_means

There are many models for clustering out there. In this notebook, we will be presenting the model that is considered the one of the simplest model among them. Despite its simplicity, k-means is vastly used for clustering in many data science applications, especially useful if you need to quickly discover insights from unlabeled data.

Some real-world applications of k-means include:

customer segmentation,
understand what the visitors of a website are trying to accomplish,
pattern recognition, and,
data compression.
In this lab, we will learn k-means clustering with 3 examples:

k-means on a randomly generated dataset.
Using k-means for customer segmentation.
